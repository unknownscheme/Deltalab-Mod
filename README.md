## DeltaLab Android Client

DeltaLab is a [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat/) client for Android.

DeltaLab uses a [modified](https://github.com/adbenitez/deltalab-core) version of the [Delta Chat Core Library](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust).

I'm making a modded version for a better user experience

How reduce the apk size? : Use [apktool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool) in builded apk, decompile and erase unnecesary files
